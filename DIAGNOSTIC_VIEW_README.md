# Diagnostic View Implementation Summary

## What Was Created

### 1. New Diagnostic View Module (`views/diagnostics.py`)
A comprehensive diagnostic tool to inspect all 126 dimensions of state vectors, including:

#### Features:
- **üìã Dimension Table**: Detailed table showing all 126 dimensions with:
  - Current value
  - Empirical min/max/range (from your 666,729 vector analysis)
  - Feature group assignment
  - Out-of-range warnings
  
- **üìä Grouped Charts**: Bar charts organized by feature type:
  - Spatial Coordinates (0-1)
  - Temporal (2-3)
  - Traffic blocks (4-24, 25-49, 50-74, 75-99)
  - High-value features (100-124)
  - Action (125)
  
- **üó∫Ô∏è Traffic Grid Interpretations**: Tests multiple hypotheses:
  - Hypothesis 1: Current code interpretation (dims 4-103 as 5√ó5√ó4)
  - Hypothesis 2: Four separate 5√ó5 blocks
  
- **üéØ Action Analysis**: Dedicated section for dimension 125:
  - Shows action value and validates range [0, 18]
  - Interprets action as spatial move + time advance
  
- **üíæ Export**: Download current vector as CSV with empirical ranges

### 2. Updated Configuration (`config.py`)
Added corrected feature indices based on your empirical analysis:
```python
EXPECTED_X_IDX = 0  # Range: [3, 48]
EXPECTED_Y_IDX = 1  # Range: [1, 81] - MISMATCH with 40-row grid!
EXPECTED_T_IDX = 2  # Range: [1, 288]
DAY_OF_WEEK_IDX = 3  # Range: [1, 6]
ACTION_DIM_IDX = 125  # Range: [0, 18]
```

**Warning comments added** about conflicts between current code assumptions and empirical evidence.

### 3. Analysis Document (`ai_context_docs/DIMENSION_ANALYSIS.md`)
Comprehensive findings document including:
- Critical issues identified (Y-range mismatch, traffic offset wrong, action not separated)
- Empirical breakdown of all 126 dimensions
- Revised hypothesis (4 metadata + four 5√ó5 grids + 21 additional + 1 action)
- Required fixes checklist
- Validation tests needed

### 4. Updated App Integration
- Added diagnostic view to `views/__init__.py`
- Wired into `app.py` as new bottom section
- Placed after action space section

## Critical Findings

### üö® Issue 1: Grid Coordinate Mismatch
- **Y coordinate range**: [1, 81] instead of expected [0, 39]
- **X coordinate range**: [3, 48] instead of expected [0, 49]
- **Implication**: Either the grid is larger than 40√ó50, or there's a coordinate transformation we're missing

### üö® Issue 2: Traffic Features Start at Wrong Index  
- **Current code**: TRAFFIC_START = 0
- **Reality**: Dims 0-3 are X, Y, T, Day ‚Äî not traffic!
- **Impact**: All traffic heatmaps (Speed/Volume/Demand/Waiting) are visualizing wrong data

### üö® Issue 3: Action Dimension Mixed with State
- **Dimension 125**: Expert action label [0, 18]
- **Current behavior**: Treated as a state feature
- **Required**: Separate state (0-124) from action (125)

## How to Use the Diagnostic View

### Step 1: Run the App
```bash
cd /home/robert/FAMAIL/data/visualization/streamlit
streamlit run app.py
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Diagnostic Section
Scroll to the bottom of the app ‚Äî the new **"üî¨ Feature Diagnostics"** section.

### Step 3: Select Test Cases
Use the sidebar to select:
- Different experts
- Different trajectories  
- Different state indices

### Step 4: Inspect Each Tab

#### Tab 1: Dimension Table
- Look for "‚ö†Ô∏è OUT OF RANGE" flags
- Verify dims 0-3 show reasonable spatial/temporal values
- Confirm dim 125 is always an integer in [0, 18]

#### Tab 2: Grouped Charts
- Check if value patterns match expected feature types
- Look for suspicious groupings or discontinuities

#### Tab 3: Traffic Grids
- **Hypothesis 1**: Current code interpretation (probably wrong)
- **Hypothesis 2**: Four separate 5√ó5 blocks (more likely correct)
- Compare which interpretation produces more sensible heatmaps

#### Tab 4: Action
- Verify action is always valid (0-18)
- Note the spatial move + time advance interpretation

### Step 5: Export Examples
- Download CSV for representative state vectors
- Save examples of normal vs suspicious vectors for offline analysis

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Validation Phase)
1. **Run diagnostic view on 10-20 diverse trajectories**
   - Different experts
   - Different times of day
   - Different locations (if you can infer from X/Y)

2. **Document patterns you observe**:
   - Are dims 0-3 always spatial/temporal?
   - Do the four 5√ó5 blocks (Hypothesis 2) look plausible?
   - Are there any state vectors with out-of-range values?

3. **Cross-check with trajectory paths**:
   - Do rendered paths match X/Y values in dims 0-1?
   - If not, there's definitely a coordinate transformation issue

### Short-term (Fix Phase)
4. **Fix traffic feature offset**:
   - Update `state_level.py` to start reading traffic at dim 4, not dim 0
   - Test that heatmaps now show reasonable traffic patterns

5. **Separate action dimension**:
   - Update all visualization code to slice `vec[:125]` for state
   - Create separate action visualization (or remove from state displays)

6. **Resolve coordinate mismatch**:
   - Investigate original data preprocessing
   - Determine if there's a grid offset or scaling factor
   - Update trajectory path rendering accordingly

### Long-term (Documentation Phase)
7. **Update all documentation**:
   - Rewrite `DATA_MODEL.md` Section 3 with corrected schema
   - Update `DEV_GUIDE.md` with new feature indices
   - Add coordinate system explanation to README

8. **Add validation tests**:
   - Automated checks for dimension ranges
   - Coordinate consistency tests
   - Action label validation

## Testing Checklist

Before making fixes, validate these hypotheses:

- [ ] Dims 0-1 contain X/Y coordinates (verify by comparing to rendered paths)
- [ ] Dim 2 is time slot in range [1, 288]
- [ ] Dim 3 is day of week in range [1, 6]
- [ ] Dims 4-28 form a coherent 5√ó5 feature grid
- [ ] Dims 29-53 form a second 5√ó5 feature grid
- [ ] Dims 54-78 form a third 5√ó5 feature grid
- [ ] Dims 79-103 form a fourth 5√ó5 feature grid
- [ ] Dim 125 is always an integer action label
- [ ] Y range [1, 81] can be mapped to 40-row grid (need transformation)
- [ ] X range [3, 48] can be mapped to 50-column grid (need transformation)

## Questions to Answer

1. **Why is Y ‚àà [1, 81] instead of [0, 39]?**
   - Investigate original data preprocessing notebooks
   - Check if there's a coarse-to-fine grid mapping

2. **Why is X ‚àà [3, 48] instead of [0, 49]?**
   - Possible edge cell exclusion?
   - Offset due to geographic boundaries?

3. **What are dimensions 104-124?** (21 dims after the four 5√ó5 blocks)
   - Additional features not yet identified
   - Possibly POI distances, temporal encodings, or driver context

4. **Are the four 5√ó5 blocks really Speed/Volume/Demand/Waiting?**
   - Or is it a different set of features?
   - Use diagnostic view to inspect value patterns

## Success Criteria

The diagnostic view is working correctly if:
- ‚úÖ It loads without errors
- ‚úÖ It displays all 126 dimensions
- ‚úÖ Grouped charts are readable
- ‚úÖ Traffic grid hypotheses render as heatmaps
- ‚úÖ Action analysis shows valid values
- ‚úÖ CSV export works

The analysis is complete when:
- [ ] You've inspected 10+ diverse state vectors

- [ ] Coordinate transformation is understood
- [ ] Feature group hypothesis is validated
- [ ] Required fixes are documented
